‚ö†Ô∏è **It cannot be used standalone** - it requires the **MegaPint Base Package** to function.

## About this Package?

The **Validators tool** is the most advanced tool in the MegaPint Collection. It allows you to **define custom rules for GameObjects** and automatically ensures they meet your project‚Äôs standards.

From **debug objects that shouldn‚Äôt appear in release builds** to **enforcing naming conventions**, Validators gives you full control over your scene and project integrity.

## Features

‚úîÔ∏è **Custom validation rules** - define requirements for any GameObject    
‚úîÔ∏è **Auto-fix functionality** - correct most issues with a single click    
‚úîÔ∏è **Scene and project-wide scanning** - quickly identify all invalid objects    
‚úîÔ∏è **Extensible system** - create your own rules with custom code    
‚úîÔ∏è **Step-by-step documentation** - guides you through setup, validation, and auto-fixes

## üîß How It Works

1. **Attach the ValidatableMonoBehaviour** to any GameObject.    
2. **Assign one or more validation requirements** directly on the object.    
3. **Trigger validation**: the tool checks all objects and flags violations.    
4. **Auto-fix issues** instantly with a single click.

## Benefits

- Maintain **project standards consistently** across all scenes
- Reduce errors caused by **forgotten debug objects** or **misconfigured GameObjects**
- Save time by **scanning entire projects** rather than checking objects manually
- Build a **custom rules library** to catch unique edge cases
